# Natural Language Understanding benchmark

This repository contains the results of two benchmarks to compare natural language understanding services offering:
1. **built-in solutions** (Apple’s SiriKit, Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s Luis, Google’s API.ai, and Snips’ SDK) for the intents covered by the [Snips SDK](https://sdk.snips.ai/). This benchmark and its results are described in length in the [following post](
https://snips.ai/content/sdk-benchmark-visualisation/).
2. **custom solutions** (a naive model based on regular expressions, Lastmile's RASA NLU, Recast.ai, and Snips' Pcfg parser) for three intents covered by the [Snips SDK](https://sdk.snips.ai/). A post about the methods and results is soon to be released.

The data is provided for each benchmark and more details about the methods are available in the README file in each folder.
